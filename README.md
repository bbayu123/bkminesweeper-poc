BKMinesweeper is a SpigotMC plugin that lets players play Minesweeper on maps.

This plugin is an example of how to use the MapDisplay system in [BKCommonLib][1].

## Installation

Compile the plugin using [maven](https://maven.apache.org/).

Navigate to the root of the project, and type

```bash
mvn
```

This plugin requires [BKCommonLib][2] to function. You need to add BKCommonLib to your Spigot server 
before adding this plugin. 
This plugin should support all versions from version 1.13.2 onwards.


## Usage

To obtain a Minesweeper game, type

```
/minesweeper get
```

To control the map, either hold the map in your main hand, and use the regular movement keys 
(defaults are `W`, `A`, `S`, `D`, `Space`, `Left Shift`) to control it; or place the map in an 
item frame, and use regular interaction keys (defaults are `Left Click` and `Right Click`) to control it.
